ones, that need to be done. Below is a checklist of things that need to be in
place for a typical project.
  Send out calendar invitations for regular ceremonies:
    
      Standups - daily, 10-15 minutes between 10:00-11:00.
      Sprint planning meetings - fortnightly, for anything between 1-3 hours,
usually on the first day of a sprint (a Wednesday).
      Retrospectives - fortnightly, usually held at the end of a sprint or before
planning.
      Show and tells - fortnightly, at the end of a sprint for most projects. The
client can help you identify a suitable time and place (we recommend keeping
it to a regular time to maximise attendance).
    
  
  Create a Slack channel and add dxw and client team members. Clients and
contractors should be set up as single-channel guests.
  Create a Trello board for the project. Use the standard dxw columns or make up
your own, depending on the needs of the project and how the team want to work.
  Create a Google Drive folder, under ‘Client work’ for the project. Use this to
store any documents, files, week notes and anything else that the team might
need access to. Make sure everyone in the team knows where to find it, and
give clients and contractors access to individual documents or sub-folders as
required.
  Set up a video-call for standups so that anyone working remotely or from
another location can join. We like to use appear.in and talky.io.
  Create a week notes document, using the template.
  Organise a kick-off meeting with the client, either a few days before the
first sprint or on the first day. The whole team should attend this.
  Check that commercial tasks have been done. It’s worth checking there’s a
signed order summary (this should be shared with you ahead of time) and this
matches the schedule in 10,000ft. Check invoices have been created in Xero and
you know where to find them. Also check 10,000ft early so you’re aware of any
upcoming holiday being taken by the team.
  Create a spreadsheet to track days worked against the order summary. This will
show you how money is being spent against the forecasted budget, and help you
in any conversations with the client about team changes, extending the project
or issues with budget.

you get the outcomes you need are below:
  Running a discovery kick-off workshop
  Running a roadmapping workshop
Aim to reach a shared understanding of what’s desired and what’s possible. This
can be a Sprint goal, a high level vision, or going through the requirements and
getting clarity on each of these points. The scope is flexible, and it varies
from project to project, but the main outcome is to make sure the team and the
client understand what will be done. You should:
  Set the client’s expectations from the beginning, and help them understand
that there are trade-offs in every decision we take
  Make sure the commercial paperwork is aligned to this discussion, and if there
are gaps or things that have been missed, bring that up, and go back to the
commercial team to inform of any changes. It timing works out, this type of
discussion is suitable for the delivery checkpoint forum that happens weekly
on Thursdays at 3.30. Gurps, our Commercial Manager, joins these.

  writing stories

for the team to define that in the first Sprint)
  dxw days, that is 9 days in a 10 day sprint
  invoicing and finances, we invoice the first day after the end of each sprint,
based on the number of days each specialist in the team worked. We might also
add travel costs, or research incentives, and other admin costs as per the
commercial agreement we have with the client
It is also important to mention that we work with roadmaps, which might change
over time as we know more about the project. This is fundamental in an agile
project, so that we can react to change as quickly as possible. Therefore, we do
have plans, but they are not set in stone.Tell the client that if, at any point, they have an issue with the way we are
working, or with any team member, the first point of contact for them is the dxw
Delivery Lead. If the DL is the problem area or if they are a contractor, the
Director of Delivery is then the next point of contact.">

projects and agree some principles for how the single team will work together.
For example, do they typically follow the GDS Service Manual?Explain how most dxw teams work, and communicate to the client that we’ve done
this successfully with different clients over the years. However, be
accommodating and suggest we “test and iterate” approaches. The retros are a
perfect avenue to explore these.There’s always something to discuss here. For example, how will week notes be
written and who should they be sent to? Who needs to be invited to show and
tells? How will user stories be written? Is there a story template the team want
to use, and will developers estimate them?">

any equipment or things the team will need. It’s also worth agreeing which days

          <h1>Setting up a new project</h1>
          <p>At dxw we frequently start new projects and work with clients we haven’t worked
with before. Delivery leads at dxw are responsible for setting up projects and
ensuring all the right things are in place for when the team starts work.</p>

<p>We often find that time is limited and transitioning between projects can be a
challenge, for delivery leads and the wider team.</p>

<p>This guide provides advice and tips, as well as a checklist for delivery leads
about to start a new project. It can work for large projects (a phase of work
like a discovery or a beta) as well as smaller projects which might only be a
few weeks long.</p>

<h2 id="before-a-project-starts">Before a project starts</h2>

<p>In most cases, there’s not a very long lead time between winning a piece of work
and starting it. We sometimes have a number of days, rather than weeks, for the

  <li>Make sure to point out who is full time/part time or if there is any different
working pattern (such as compressed hours, any days they are not working,
etc…)</li>
  <li>Prep the client about what the day will look like and set expectations. For
example who they should bring and what the agenda should be.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="get-to-a-shared-understanding-of-what-the-work-and-priorities-are">Get to a shared understanding of what the work and priorities are</h3>

<p>There are a number of outcomes you should aim to get out of a kick-off. This is
important especially if we are working with that client for the first time and
there are areas that are not very clear to us, or to them. You can structure a
kick-off in the way that works best for you, but some frameworks that will help
you get the outcomes you need are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/guides/running-a-discovery-kick-off-workshop">Running a discovery kick-off workshop</a></li>
  <li><a href="/guides/running-a-roadmapping-workshop">Running a roadmapping workshop</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Aim to reach a shared understanding of what’s desired and what’s possible. This
can be a Sprint goal, a high level vision, or going through the requirements and
getting clarity on each of these points. The scope is flexible, and it varies
from project to project, but the main outcome is to make sure the team and the
client understand what will be done. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set the client’s expectations from the beginning, and help them understand
that there are trade-offs in every decision we take</li>
  <li>Make sure the commercial paperwork is aligned to this discussion, and if there
are gaps or things that have been missed, bring that up, and go back to the
commercial team to inform of any changes. It timing works out, this type of
discussion is suitable for the delivery checkpoint forum that happens weekly
on Thursdays at 3.30. Gurps, our Commercial Manager, joins these.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="talk-about-dxw-ways-of-working">Talk about dxw ways of working</h3>

<p>Give an overview of how dxw works. Don’t assume that everyone in the client team
has read the original proposal or visited the dxw website. Explain how we work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agile mindset</li>
  <li>culture</li>
  <li>our approach to delivery</li>
  <li>GDS Service Manual</li>
  <li>sprint ceremonies</li>
  <li>writing stories</li>
  <li>story workflow (this is different from team to team)</li>
  <li>the code review process (again might be different in each team, and it’s ok
for the team to define that in the first Sprint)</li>
  <li>dxw days, that is 9 days in a 10 day sprint</li>
  <li>invoicing and finances, we invoice the first day after the end of each sprint,
based on the number of days each specialist in the team worked. We might also
add travel costs, or research incentives, and other admin costs as per the
commercial agreement we have with the client</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also important to mention that we work with roadmaps, which might change
over time as we know more about the project. This is fundamental in an agile
project, so that we can react to change as quickly as possible. Therefore, we do
have plans, but they are not set in stone.</p>

<p>Tell the client that if, at any point, they have an issue with the way we are
working, or with any team member, the first point of contact for them is the dxw
Delivery Lead. If the DL is the problem area or if they are a contractor, the
Director of Delivery is then the next point of contact.</p>

<h3 id="discuss-how-the-team-want-to-work">Discuss how the team want to work</h3>

<p>Clients will have their own way of working on projects and if they’ve used agile
approaches before, it may be a different flavour of agile to what the dxw team
are used to. Ask the client team to talk about how they’re used to working on
projects and agree some principles for how the single team will work together.
For example, do they typically follow the GDS Service Manual?</p>

<p>Explain how most dxw teams work, and communicate to the client that we’ve done
this successfully with different clients over the years. However, be
accommodating and suggest we “test and iterate” approaches. The retros are a
perfect avenue to explore these.</p>

<p>There’s always something to discuss here. For example, how will week notes be
written and who should they be sent to? Who needs to be invited to show and
tells? How will user stories be written? Is there a story template the team want
to use, and will developers estimate them?</p>

<h3 id="talk-about-co-location">Talk about co-location</h3>

<p>If you’re going to be co-located with the client, ask to visit the office space
and have a look around. Make sure that the team have access to the site (do they
need passes) and that you have space to work. This includes space to run sprint
meetings and show and tells. Work with the Commercial Operations team to order
any equipment or things the team will need. It’s also worth agreeing which days
will be spent co-lo and which at dxw in this meeting. Take the teams working
patterns into account.</p>

<p>When the team are going to be in different locations, think about technology and
how to make sure each team member is able to join meetings and work with others.
It might be useful to buy some extra microphones, good headphones or additional
screens for the team. Chat to Olivia if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Cover the following tech for collaboration: Slack, Google drive, Trello, Miro
boards, Google Hangouts or Go2Meeting, Calendars (team and personal).</p>
