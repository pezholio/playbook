  Quantitative vs. qualitative sorts An automated quantitative sort online
can be a good start to identify categories. They can also be used to test your
sort on a larger scale after the in-person sessions.
  Granularity is important Pieces of content selected for the cards can be
from individual pages, functionality, small groups of pages, or whole sections
of the site. Be consistent with the groups you are working with otherwise
participants will struggle and there will be a lot of inconditency between
groupings.
  People get tired Avoid the temptation to sort everything in one go. Limit
the number to 30-40 cards
  Consider the loudest voices When discussing the reasons for groupings and
moving things around to reach a consensus, be mindful of the loudest people in
the room and how this affects results
  Randomise When giving participants a stack of content cards, make sure to
randomise the order they’re in

number
