          <h1>Managing the Playbook</h1>
          <p>This is the content strategy for dxw Playbook.</p>

<p>It describes the purpose and users of the Playbook, the kinds of material it
contains, how we manage and update the Playbook, and its current intended
structure.</p>

<h2 id="playbook-purpose-and-users">Playbook purpose and users</h2>

<h3 id="agreed-ways-of-working">Agreed ways of working</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of the Playbook is to document our current, agreed ways of
working.</p>

<p>This purpose also defines the primary audience and users of the Playbook -
people currently working at dxw. The Playbook should help them work together
efficiently and effectively. Secondary audiences and users of the Playbook are
people working at actual or potential clients, and people who are thinking about
coming to work at dxw. The Playbook should help them understand what it might be
like to work with us.</p>

<p>We also know that people in other organisations look at the Playbook. Although
we don’t create any content specifically for them, the Playbook should leave
like-minded people with a good impression of us.</p>

<h3 id="staff-policies">Staff policies</h3>

<p>The Playbook is also where we publish pay, benefits and other staff policy
information.</p>

<p>This primary audience for this information is people currently working at dxw. A
secondary audience is people who are thinking about coming to work at dxw.</p>

<h2 id="playbook-content">Playbook content</h2>

<p>We divide the Playbook into Topic overviews, Guides and Policies.</p>

<h3 id="topic-overview">Topic overview</h3>

<p>Each section of the Playbook should have some overview material that describes
important values and principles, and lists relevant guides.</p>

<p>We write overview content so that it can be understood by anyone who is likely
to look at the Playbook.</p>

<h3 id="guide">Guide</h3>

<p>A guide describes our current agreement on how we do something. Each guide
should be aimed at a specific group of people and explain how to do a specific
activity.</p>

<p>We write guides to meet the needs of their specific audience and users. While
guides should be clear and simple, they can use subject specific language that
we are confident is understood by the intended audience and users.</p>

<h3 id="policy">Policy</h3>

<p>A policy describes an official company policy and any associated procedures.</p>

<p>We write policies so that they can be easily found, understood and acted on by
all the staff who need to follow them.</p>

<h2 id="playbook-governance-and-workflow">Playbook governance and workflow</h2>

<h3 id="ownership">Ownership</h3>

<p>Each section of the Playbook has an identified owner, typically either the
director of the relevant part of the business, or the head of the relevant
profession.</p>

<p>The owner is responsible for making sure that their parts of the Playbook:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to reflect our current ways of working and policies</li>
  <li>are findable, readable, understandable and actionable by its intended audience
