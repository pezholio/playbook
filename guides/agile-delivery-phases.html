          <h1>Agile delivery phases</h1>
          <p>In 2011, the UK government established the Government Digital Service (GDS) to
implement the ‘Digital by Default’ strategy proposed by Martha Lane Fox. GDS and
the ‘Digital by Default’ strategy intended to revolutionise the way citizens
interact with public services and government departments. Central to GDS’
approach is the Service Manual. The Service Manual provides guidance and support
to public sector organisations for creating and running better digital services.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">www.gov.uk/service-manual</a></p>

<p>The Service Manual describes how an <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile approach</a>
to delivering projects can lead to better digital services.</p>

<p>The core principles of an agile approach are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on user needs</li>
  <li>Deliver iteratively</li>
  <li>Keep improving how your team works</li>
  <li>Fail fast and learn quickly</li>
  <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
</ul>

<p>The Service Manual describes four stages of agile delivery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discovery</li>
  <li>Alpha</li>
  <li>Beta</li>
  <li>Live</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>

<p>Before committing to building something, we need to understand what the user
needs are and if a new thing is needed. This is <strong>discovery</strong>.</p>

<p>Discovery de-risks the future. It allows us to understand the scope of a problem
and the best way to proceed in response.</p>

<p>Activities in discovery include:</p>

  <li>Findings about current processes or the existing service.</li>
  <li>Estimated scale and costs for developing a new service.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alpha">Alpha</h2>

work for users and how it will integrate with existing processes and systems.
<strong>This is alpha.</strong></p>
