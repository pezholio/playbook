provide to clients or other stakeholders. Claims in this category are

is particularly important that these claims are necessary and proportionate.

else that fits. Please check before using it.

Printing here would include business cards or headed paper, but would not
include flyers or brochures, which should go under 400 - Advertising &

Consumables is a catch-all for items which have little or no resale value; for

bill if you have made calls or used data on a personal device.

          <h1>Claiming expenses</h1>
          <p>This guide gives details on the information you need to provide to claim an
expense. For more general information about expenses, visit the
<a href="/#claiming-expenses">Expenses section of the Playbook</a>.</p>

<p>We create expenses using Xero. There is an Expenses section on the page after
you log in where you can see details of your expenses. If you’re expensing
something new, you can go
<a href="https://expenses.xero.com/!wrUP-/detail/create-new">straight to the form</a>.</p>

<p>To create an expense, you add all the receipts related to it to Xero, and submit
them together as a claim. If you don’t have receipts, you’ll need to talk to
Vanessa.</p>

<p>Each receipt requires the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Receipt from</strong>: The full company name of the seller</li>
  <li><strong>Date</strong>: The date on the receipt (ie, the date the expense was incurred, not
the date you’re adding it)</li>
  <li><strong>Reference</strong>: The invoice or receipt number, or some other unique identifier</li>
  <li><strong>Total</strong>: Leave this as 0.00: Xero will calculate it for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy of receipt</strong>:: Just above the Total field, you should see a small file
icon. Use this to upload a photograph or scan of your receipt. If you upload a
photograph, make sure it’s legible.</li>
  <li><strong>Description, quantity and unit price</strong>:: Add the the description of the line
item on the receipt. If that text is not very descriptive, though, consider
elaborating. Add the quantity and the price of an individual item.</li>
  <li><strong>Account</strong>:: See below.</li>
  <li><strong>Tax rate</strong>:: The tax rate will be set automatically from the account you
select, however you must check that it is correct. Check your receipt to see
what VAT, if any, was charged. If you cannot see a reference to VAT, select No
VAT in this field. It is very important to get this right as this data feeds
directly into our VAT returns.</li>
  <li><strong>Products</strong>:: If the expense relates to a particular area of work (at the
time of writing: Agency, Hosting or Citrulu), select the applicable product.
If not, leave it blank.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="choosing-an-expense-account">Choosing an expense account</h2>

<p>Each item on a receipt needs to be allocated against a specific expense account.
This is so that we can tell how much we spend on categories of things. If you
have a receipt or invoice with a large number of items that all fit in a single
account, it’s fine to total them up and add that as one line.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure what account type to use, please ask. Do not use General
Expenses unless there is definitely no other account that is suitable.</p>
