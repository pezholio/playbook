    Are they members of the public, professionals or staff? Are they current or
potential users?

    What different groups, job roles, circumstances, environments, access needs
and support needs might be important? Who might currently be worst served and
most likely to experience barriers?

    How will we engage and involve the different people we need to work with?
  
  
    What organisations and stakeholders are involved?

    Are they colleagues from our organisation or other public sector bodies? What
community, civil society, professional and advocacy groups might be
important?

    What is their relationship to the work? What expectations and concerns might
they have? How closely might they be involved? How might they help?
  
  
    What outcomes will users get?

    What do we know about their intentions? What problems might we solve for
them?

    What’s working that we might build on? What unintended consequences might we
create?

decisions are we trying to make?

technology?
  
  
    What do we need to learn or prove?

    What questions are we trying to answer? What do we need to know to make good
decisions? What might we already know?

    What assumptions should we be exploring and testing? What biases and gaps in
understanding might we have?

    What might we need to show for our conclusions to be accepted?
  
  
    What do we need to communicate?

    What meetings, governance and other processes do we need to feed into?

    What outputs might we expect to create? Why and for who?

    How will we share information? How will we make our communications accessible
and inclusive?
  
  
    What other work relates to this?

    What has been done before, or is being done now?

    What can we learn from each other? What should we share? How do we stay
aligned with that work?
  
  
    What difficulties might we face?

    How might we be blocked? What rabbit holes could we fall down?

  Write each question on a separate sheet of paper on a wall, or frame on a
Miro board, or column on a Trello board.
  Get the people you need together in a room or on a video call.
For each question:
  Ask the question to get a discussion started.
  Write bullet points on the appropriate sheet, or on sticky notes or cards to
summarise what people say.
  Ask follow up questions to clarify what you hear and to make sure you include
everyone’s thoughts.
  Ask about priority and scope. What’s essential? And what’s out of scope?
  You can facilitate this on your own, but the first few times you might want
to have a separate moderator and scribe. And it always helps to have another
colleague in the crowd who is focussed on listening and picking up on
anything you miss.
It’s best to put all the questions up together. The things people say in the
discussion will often relate to more than one question – for example, people
often mention outcomes for the organisation when they talk about why we’re doing
the work. With all the questions up you can place items under the appropriate
question.This method works well for groups up to 10 and typically takes 2 to 3 hours
depending on the breadth and complexity of the work.">

          <h1>Running a discovery kick-off workshop</h1>
          <p>This guide explains how we run a kick-off workshop for a discovery project at
dxw digital.</p>

<p>For an alpha or beta, or for a significant update to a live service, we run a
<a href="/guides/running-a-roadmapping-workshop">roadmapping workshop</a>.</p>

<p>For discovery focussed projects it can be less clear what the end result will
be, and whether we’re looking at a single service or cutting across several. So
we use a broader set of questions.</p>

<p>These are based on the
<a href="https://www.hollidazed.co.uk/2015/07/28/frame-the-problem">questions to frame a problem</a>
that <a href="https://twitter.com/BenHolliday">Ben Holiday</a> wrote about, the
<a href="https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/setting-up-a-discovery">discovery inception categories</a>
that <a href="https://twitter.com/myddelton">Will Myddelton</a> described, along with some
of the roadmapping questions.</p>
