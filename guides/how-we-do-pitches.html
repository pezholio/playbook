buyer for the invitation and give them any information they need (such as names
of attendees).Think about the logistics. Look at all the emails or any notes from
conversations with the buyer and pull out any deadlines and important dates. Put
the dates into the pitch members’ calendars and set reminders in Slack so we are
all clear when the deadline is.Factor in time to rehearse the pitch, ideally a day before to give us time to
make any last minute changes or more time to practice. Whoever is co-ordinating
the pitch should make sure this happens. As well as the bid team members, invite
others to attend the run-through to act as an audience.Prepare some good questions for the assessment panel. There is usually an

These should form the initial headings for the pitch deck and the weightings
should give you an idea of how much time to devote to each part of the deck. If
you feel you need to, read up on
the Digital Outcomes and Specialists scoring process and how weighting works.Look at previous pitches for inspiration. It’s fine to reuse slides from
previous pitches if they are relevant. That said, it’s important that the pitch
reflects back the buyer’s language so if there are key phrases they use in the
brief, it’s good to speak to those.Try to write positively. If you want to say “there are no contractors on the
team”, consider rephrasing as “all our team-members are full-time” to avoid
someone mishearing and getting the opposite message than you intend. So, unless
you’re trying to achieve a particular effect, say what we do and just avoid
saying what we don’t.The slides should always convey the message or most important theme of each
slide. Avoid making them too wordy—use the speaker notes to explain context and
detail. When you’re writing the speaker notes, remember that you’re going to be
presenting so write in the most appropriate format that helps you deliver the
pitch. For example, avoid long paragraphs, fiddly phrases or difficult
alliteration.Make sure you feel ownership of your slides and speaker notes—if they’re not
written in the way you’d say them, either tweak them so they’re in your “voice”,
or try reducing them to simple prompts.Put in plenty of line breaks to make the notes easy to read, especially if you
plan to ad-lib. Add the name(s) of the people who’ll be talking at the top of
the speaker notes for each slide. Know when the next slide is yours!You can refine the words after you’ve run through the pitch to make sure the
deck tells the story you want to tell. The slides need to flow so try and
establish a narrative arc, i.e. the slides should make sense in sequence as you
tell the story.Allow up to two minutes per slide.">

          <p>Pitching is an opportunity to demonstrate our expertise, showcase our work and
