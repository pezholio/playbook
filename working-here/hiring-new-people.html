          <h4 id="process">Process</h4>

<h5 id="making-a-plan-for-hiring">Making a plan for hiring</h5>

<p>The hiring lead works with HR to create a plan for hiring using
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oN961FE41BWPyrVrPbHCES2D78eB0nbVp7dxZzHkMb8/edit">the hiring doc template</a>.
This includes planning for each stage of recruitment by doing the following;</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up the roles in <a href="https://www.beapplied.com/">Applied</a> where we manage the
hiring process</li>
  <li>write our sifting and interview questions, and their review guides</li>
  <li>work out who will be part of the hiring team and try to make sure that
interview panels are diverse</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="writing-a-job-description">Writing a job description</h5>

<p>Before deciding to advertise a new job, we try to write an inclusive job
description. The hiring lead will work with heads of professions, the hiring
team, and the HR team to make sure that they’ve gathered what they need and to
get feedback on it. We’ve written about our approach to job descriptions here
<a href="https://www.dxw.com/2021/01/how-to-write-inclusive-job-descriptions/">on our blog</a>.</p>

<p>We always include a salary band in the job description.</p>

<p>Once the hiring lead has a first draft they will put the job description through
<a href="http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/">The Gender Decoder</a> and make relevant
changes before sharing with the Diversity and Inclusion group for a final
review.</p>

<p>We then publish the job advert on
<a href="https://www.dxw.com/careers/">our careers page</a>.</p>

<h5 id="finding-people">Finding people</h5>

<p>We sometimes find people through our networks, and share our jobs on Twitter and
LinkedIn.</p>

<p>We also always advertise on specialist jobs boards as relevant. We have a budget
to advertise roles and encourage hiring leads to think about how they could use
this to attract more diverse applicants. We use the following job boards:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.hustlecrew.co/">Hustle Crew</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://codingblackfemales.com/">Coding Black Females</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.adaslist.co/">Ada’s List</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.escapethecity.org/">Escape the City</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We typically don’t use recruiters.</p>

<p>We always welcome general applications if there’s not an open vacancy.</p>

<h5 id="reviewing-applications">Reviewing applications</h5>

<p>The hiring lead and the hiring team review applications to decide who to take
forward.</p>

<p>We check whether applicants might be able to carry out the job description, and
decide whether to take them to the next stage.</p>

<p>We always inform candidates if they are not being taken to the next stage.</p>

<h5 id="sifting-questions">Sifting questions</h5>

<p>All candidates are required to answer sifting questions as part of their
application. These questions are written by the hiring team and are a chance for
candidates to explain their skillset by answering role specific questions.</p>

<h5 id="interviewing">Interviewing</h5>

<p>Interviews are an hour long with two members of the team. Candidates have a
choice of google hangouts or Zoom as their platform to interview on.</p>

<p>dxw interviews are informal. They are a semi-structured conversation. We use
competency-based questions, and look for answers that describe a candidate’s own
experience.</p>

<p>Interviewers should take notes during the interview.</p>

<p>We include time in interviews for candidates to ask questions, whether about
dxw, the role, or the process. We will always try to answer, but we will check
things if we need to and get back to them.</p>

<p>Directly after an interview, the interviewers will add their notes to Applied
without discussing the candidate first. Once all of the interviews are
completed, the hiring team will meet to discuss who will progress to the next
stage.</p>

<p>If a candidate is not being taken to the next stage, we will provide detailed
feedback from the interview.</p>

<h5 id="simulating-a-work-day-some-roles-only">Simulating a work day [some roles only]</h5>

<p>A simulated work day is a 2-3 hour activity based on a real world problem or
task. We use this to make sure that a candidate is capable of taking on a role.
We also find out about how a candidate approaches their work. It also gives the
candidate the chance to meet more people they would be working with and to
understand more about the role, how we work, and the expectations of the job
itself.</p>

<p>The activity itself will be variable dependent on role - for technical roles,
this might involve pairing with one of our developers, or for delivery roles,
running a planning session for a team. The activity will always involve working
in conjunction with someone in a similar role to the one the candidate is
applying for.</p>

<p>We send candidates the task and an explanation at least 24 hours before the work
day, so that they have a chance to read and understand the scope of the
activity, to prepare anything they need to, or to pull out if they don’t feel
like they are a good fit.</p>

<p>At the end of a work day, we ask the candidate to briefly and informally present
their activity to a small group.</p>

<p>After all work days are completed, the hiring team will meet. For candidates who
have not been successful, we will provide detailed feedback from the interview
and work day.</p>

<h5 id="offering-the-job">Offering the job</h5>

<p>When we are ready to offer a job, the HR manager will call and email the
candidate with the details of the offer, including salary and a proposed start
date. If the candidate accepts the offer, we start the onboarding process. If
they have queries, the HR manager will discuss them with them and make
adjustments where possible and appropriate.</p>

<p>Offers are subject to successfully completing eligibility to work in the UK
checks and a background check including BPSS and BS7858. We need to do this
vetting due to restrictions in our client contracts.</p>

<h5 id="onboarding-and-probation">Onboarding and probation</h5>

<p>New starters are subject to a probation period of 4 months with dxw having the
option to extend by 2 months. Probationary periods go both ways, it is also a
chance for a new employee to find their feet and dxws way of working. In your
probation meeting your line manager will share feedback that they have gathered
from those you have worked with closely.</p>

<p>Onboarding will vary by role and experience. New starters have a checklist they
follow to guide them through their first few weeks. New starters will be paired
with a <a href="https://playbook.dxw.com/#support-paths">helper</a> from their first day.</p>

<h4 id="returners-programme">Returners’ programme</h4>

<p>dxw is proud to offer return to work opportunities for experienced hires who are
looking to re-enter the workplace after an extended period of time away.</p>

<p>We’re running a pilot to begin with to see how this works for us and the people
joining us. We’ll start by taking on one or two people for 3 to 6 months -
depending on the role and circumstances. There’s potential to become a permanent
member of the team at the end of the placement, but this isn’t guaranteed.</p>

<p>Initially this opportunity will only be offered within our London team, with a
view to including our Leeds office as the team there grows.</p>

<h5 id="who-supports-you">Who supports you?</h5>

<p>You will be supported by our people team from the point of application.</p>

<p>If you’re invited into our recruitment process, it will consist of a one hour
interview followed by a collaborative activity with the team which will be sent
to you 24 hours in advance so you have time to prepare.</p>

<p>The interview will be an informal, semi-structured conversation where there will
be the opportunity for us to learn more about you and your experience and, just
as importantly, for you to get a feel for what it’s like to work at dxw.</p>

<p>If you join us, you’ll be continuously supported by our people team, a line
manager and a mentor within the same field. You‘ll have regular check ins with
the team where you can speak openly about anything that’s on your mind.</p>

<h5 id="client-facing-role">Client facing role</h5>

<p>For client-facing roles we’ll start billing your time back to the client when we
feel the time is right. This will be something we discuss openly during the
recruitment process and through your regular check ins.</p>

<h4 id="internal-facing-roles">Internal facing roles</h4>

<p>We’re also offering internal facing roles, for example, in our busy commercial
and marketing teams who also support our sister company, Tradecraft. These roles
are not billed back to our clients.</p>

<p>If you think this might be for you, please apply through our jobs page.</p>
