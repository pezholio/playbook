<p>Individuals should be proactive in taking responsibility for their own

<p>You can find out who your line manager is in BreatheHR on the summary section of
your profile page.</p>

<h5 id="line-management-principles">Line management principles</h5>

<h6 id="communicate-clearly">Communicate clearly</h6>

<p>Communication is a two-way process and it is important to check understanding
and confidence, and value the other person in decision-making. Explaining the
task and its objectives clearly means people know what’s expected of them and
the part they play. It empowers them to take responsibility and own how they
approach the work.</p>

<h6 id="recognise-achievement-and-celebrate-success">Recognise achievement and celebrate success</h6>

<p>A simple ‘thank you’ shows someone that what they have done is appreciated, and
is hugely motivating. Celebrating major, and minor, achievements is an important
part of our culture at dxw. It builds team spirit and morale.</p>

<h6 id="guard-our-values">Guard our values</h6>

<p>Lead by example. The actions and behaviours of line managers must always
demonstrate our dxw values. We should always hold ourselves accountable to our
values, and encourage the same in all of our colleagues, including those we line
manage.</p>

<h6 id="continuous-constructive-feedback">Continuous constructive feedback</h6>

<p>Find out how each of your team members prefers to receive feedback, and develop
an approach which reflects that. Ongoing positive and constructive feedback is
essential if someone is to feel valued, learn from their experiences and become
better at what they do.</p>

<h6 id="be-honest">Be honest</h6>

<p>Being honest means telling the truth and being consistent in what you say and
who you say it to. Telling things as they are, while being sensitive to the
situation and individual, ensures that people know where they stand and will
help to build mutual trust and respect.</p>

<h6 id="wellbeing">Wellbeing</h6>

<p>Line managers look out for the health and wellbeing of the team. They are
responsible for carrying out dxw’s duty of care to its people.</p>

<h4 id="one-to-ones-with-your-line-manager">One-to-ones with your line manager</h4>

<h5 id="purpose">Purpose</h5>

<p>For your manager to help you with your personal and professional development,
your wellbeing, and to build a trusting relationship between the two of you.</p>

<h5 id="overview">Overview</h5>

<p>These meetings are about you; ideally you will feel happy driving the meeting.
If you’re not confident doing this, or are unsure how best to approach it, your
manager will help you to get there.</p>

<h5 id="agenda-and-topics">Agenda and topics</h5>

<p>Coming to your 1:1s with a list of things you’d like to discuss will help you
make the most of the time. Some things you might find productive to talk about
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your career and growth goals:</strong> Don’t assume your manager knows all your
aspirations. Bring them up in your 1:1s. Your manager understands you won’t
work for them forever and they want you to have a happy, fulfilling career —
whatever that means to you. Tip: if you want to talk about your long-term
goals but feel uneasy about it, ask your manager to do the same.</li>
  <li><strong>Team improvement:</strong> Have an idea that will help your team to work better?
Use your manager as a sounding board to help you refine and implement your
suggestion.</li>
  <li><strong>Self improvement:</strong> Got a specific thing you’d like some help, coaching or
feedback on? A technical skill or a soft skill? Your 1:1 is the place to bring
it up. Remember that you can use the 1:1s that fall between career progression
reviews to discuss any of the proficiencies you’re currently trying to level
up on.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal issues:</strong> Anything going on outside of work that’s affecting your
wellbeing? Physical or mental illness, bereavement, family issues, stress? The
more you can tell your manager, the more they can try to help, and make
accommodations for you at work.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpersonal issues:</strong> Having problems with a coworker? Your manager can
help mediate or coach you through how to deal with the issue.</li>
  <li><strong>Retrospection:</strong> If at any time you feel like your 1:1s aren’t particularly
productive or helpful, or you’d like to change something about them, don’t
hesitate to bring this up with your manager.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="frequency">Frequency</h5>

<p>1:1s should happen at least once per fortnight. Where possible they’ll be
face-to-face, either in the office or out for a walk, or a coffee. Where that’s
not possible, remote is perfectly fine. There’ll always be a Google Meet link in
the calendar invite.</p>

<p>If you need to reschedule your 1:1, let your manager know at the earliest
opportunity.</p>

<h5 id="meeting-length">Meeting length</h5>

<p>An hour or so, at least once every two weeks, is a good standard to aim for. If
you meet weekly, a little shorter is fine.</p>

<h4 id="personal-learning-and-development-allowance">Personal learning and development allowance</h4>

<p>We have an annual allowance of £750 and up to 4 days per person, to be used for
a range of professional and personal development activities like workshops,
short courses or conferences. dxw pays for the event ticket, travel, and
accommodation, but you will need to cover your own costs for food, drink and
supplementary equipment.</p>

<p>You should discuss your training plan with your line manager, they will help you
identify potential areas for development and support you to find suitable events
or training.</p>

<p>You may also use the allowance to attend a non role based conference or event
focused on improving your health and wellbeing. You will receive two days off
for this, and can top up the time from your annual leave allowance.</p>

<p>Attending conferences and events that are not related to your role, is a taxable
benefit. As your employer, we will make the declaration, HMRC will then adjust
your tax code accordingly to collect the tax via PAYE.</p>

<h5 id="how-it-works">How it works</h5>

<p>The allowance will be available to everyone once they have completed their
probation period, within the dxw financial year which runs from the start of
July to end June. It will be pro-rata for staff who work part-time. If you don’t
spend your allowance within the financial year, it cannot be carried over. We
will start afresh each year, as part of our annual budgeting cycle. Your
allowance is counted as being spent at the time of purchase rather than at time
of use; for example, if you buy a conference ticket in May for an event in July
the same year, the deduction will be made to the budget for the financial year
that May falls within.</p>

<p>Any events (paid, free, speaking, etc) you attend should be logged in BreatheHR
as a training request. If they do require payment, please include weblinks and
an estimate of the ticket, accommodation and travel costs (up to the maximum of
£750, though you are welcome to pay the difference for more expensive events).
This helps manage the annual budget and will give you a great view of what you
have attended in the year.</p>

<p>It’s ok for members of the team to go together, but we need to ensure that
training days have the lowest impact on client work, so there may be times we
need to consider whether your request is possible. Our Director of Delivery will
help with prioritisation in those circumstances.</p>

<p>We know that lots of training isn’t paid for, and involves things like coaching
and mentoring, learning from colleagues, being an active part of networks, and
other self-directed learning. We will encourage and support people who want to
use unbilled days for different types of professional development.</p>

<p>If appropriate, it’d be great if you would talk about your experiences in a blog
post or bikeshed - sharing good events and useful training will give others the
opportunity to attend.</p>

<p>At the end of each financial year we will review our financial position with the
intention of increasing the annual allowance.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact the HR team.</p>

<h4 id="support-for-professional-qualifications">Support for professional qualifications</h4>

<p>We may pay for a qualification or training that exceeds the annual £750
individual learning and development allowance, when that course is relevant and
helpful to both dxw and the individual. This is a benefit that comes into effect
once you have passed your probationary period.</p>

<p>We will agree to pay on the understanding that if you leave dxw, you may be
liable to repay some or all of the fees and expenses incurred.</p>

<p>Other than in exceptional circumstances, which will be decided at the Directors’
discretion, you will be required to repay dxw as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you leave dxw before you attend the course, you will repay 100% of the
costs that dxw cannot recover from the course provider.</li>
  <li>If you leave dxw during the course or within 9 months of completing it, you
will repay 75% of the costs.</li>
  <li>If you leave dxw more than 9 months and no more than 12 months after
completing the course, you will repay 50% of the costs.</li>
  <li>If you leave dxw more than 12 months after completing the course, no repayment
will be required.</li>
</ul>

<p>We appreciate that these percentages won’t always work given the length of the
qualification, and so the final percentage will be at the discretion of the
Directors and will be agreed with the individual prior to approval of the
course.</p>

<p>You will not be required to repay any costs in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compulsory or voluntary redundancy</li>
  <li>Retirement due to sickness</li>

and speak to your line manager or the People Manager if you would like support
from dxw to complete a professional qualification.</p>

<h4 id="private-slack-channels">Private Slack channels</h4>

<p>We encourage everyone at dxw to be open about their identities and the
challenges they experience at work, but sometimes we want to only talk to people
whose experiences more closely resemble our own. To enable that, we have created
a number of private channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>#identity-lgbtqia-plus (contact a member of @identity-lgbtqia-plus-admins to
join)</li>
  <li>#identity-gender-minority (contact a member of
@identity-gender-minority-admins to join)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone can create a new one by creating the private channel, creating a user
group with at least one volunteer (or asking a Slack admin to do it for you),
and adding it to this list. It’s probably a good idea to share that you’ve
created it in #general.</p>

<p>The membership of those channels is also private to protect those people, and
members of a channel are expected to keep everything in those channels private.</p>

<p>We don’t police membership of these channels, and trust everyone to be honest
about their identities. <strong>Don’t invite anyone without first asking them if they
want to be invited.</strong></p>

<h4 id="book-purchase">Book purchase</h4>

<p>If there is a book relevant to your work that you would like to read, make a
request through the #help-purchasing slack channel and the Bus Ops team will buy
it for the library.</p>

<h4 id="cycle-to-work-scheme">Cycle to work scheme</h4>

<p>dxw operates a cycle-to-work scheme, which may allow you to purchase a bicycle
at reduced cost. If you would like to take this up, please register
<a href="https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/18eb71">on the cycle scheme website</a></p>

<h4 id="eyecare-vouchers">Eyecare vouchers</h4>

<p>dxw provides eyecare for the team via a voucher system run by ASE Corporate
Eyecare Ltd and Boots.</p>

<p>Details of what the wellbeing voucher offers can be found here:
<a href="https://www.eyecareplans.co.uk/corporate-eyecare/eyecare-for-wellbeing/">Eyecare for Wellbeing</a>.</p>

<h4 id="backpack-and-other-personal-equipment">Backpack and other personal equipment</h4>

<p>dxw will pay for the equipment needed to enable you to work comfortably and
safely. dxw also offers a budget of £25 towards a work backpack. Use the
help-purchasing Slack channel to request any equipment you need, or talk to
anyone in business operations if you are unsure if a purchase will be covered.</p>

<h4 id="support-paths">Support paths</h4>

<h5 id="helpers">Helpers</h5>

<p>When you join dxw you will be assigned a helper. This person will work closely
with you for at least your first 4 months. They will do a similar job to you,
help you meet members of the wider team, catch up with you on at least a 3/6/12
week basis to ensure you are receiving everything you need, and will NEVER get
bored of your questions!</p>

<p>If you feel that you’re not getting as much time with your helper as you’d like,
please speak to the People Manager.</p>

<p>As a helper, you will be vital in ensuring you have the regular catch ups - if
you are finding it hard to schedule them, please do talk to Bus Ops.</p>

<p>For more information on being a helper, please see the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dc3IRZ_ze7QzMQTHO70ZC6hU8cig5ds7LN2MoHmPBe8/edit">checklist</a>
or speak to the People Manager.</p>

<h5 id="buddies">Buddies</h5>

<p>Once you have passed your 4 month probation, we would like you to choose a buddy
within the company to support you.</p>

<p>We recommend this person <strong>doesn’t</strong> work directly with you, someone in a
different role and that you don’t work closely with on projects, as this will
give you a second pair of ears and a whole new set of experiences to draw on.</p>

<p>This is not mandatory, just recommended and similarly not everyone may wish to
be a buddy - don’t be afraid to ask or say no. It can be reciprocal but doesn’t
have to be. Also, if you feel that a change of buddy would benefit you for
whatever reason or that you’re no longer able to be a buddy, this should also
not be an awkward situation. If you have any concerns, have a chat with the
People Manager.</p>

<p>The buddy system is there to help us all improve, to make sure we’re doing the
right kind of work and to check that we’re dealing with practical problems we’re
facing. It’s not line management, so it’s not the right place to talk about
holiday, salary, sickness, absence or anything disciplinary. If you need to talk
about those things, talk to the People Manager.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about how the buddy system works, how often to meet and
suggested discussion topics, see the buddy
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBKwPLFsGWUUzeYAObcFLQJyTPknkLhm2HrbuHwxelU/edit?usp=sharing">crib sheet</a>.
This shouldn’t be a huge time commitment, ideally just a pleasant Friday meet
up.</p>

<h5 id="your-delivery-lead-for-those-on-client-work">Your delivery lead (for those on client work)</h5>

<p>There will be opportunities within the delivery team to raise any issues or
concerns you might have e.g. retrospectives or planning sessions. As well as
this, or if you’d prefer to talk one on one, the delivery lead working on the
project will be available to provide support and guidance.</p>

<h5 id="directors-and-heads-of">Directors and heads-of</h5>

<p>All members of the Directors and heads-of team are here to help answer any
questions you might have. Your own Director and/or Head-of profession or
location is there to provide support on matters relating to dxw and your career
with us, as well as profession specific questions. Similarly, they are here if
you need to escalate any job-related concerns.</p>

<h5 id="our-managing-director-dave">Our Managing Director, Dave</h5>

<p>At dxw, all doors are open if you need to raise a concern or just have a chat -
this includes our MD. Dave is always available to discuss any questions you have
about the company and its future. Equally, if you feel you need to escalate
anything to him, don’t hesitate to get in touch. Dave’s diary is open and you
can see it on Google Calendar. If you would like to schedule some time with him,
please feel free to book something.</p>
