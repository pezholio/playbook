          <h1>Who we are</h1>
          <p>dxw is an independent digital agency that works with the public and third
sectors.</p>

<p>Since 2008, we’ve worked in partnership with our clients to improve people’s
lives by designing, building, operating, and improving digital public services.
We support the public sector teams we work with to build their own digital
capability and take an iterative user-centred approach to service design.</p>

<p>The challenge facing the public sector today is a significant one. There’s more
pressure than ever to deliver online services quickly and save money. It’s a
huge job and, in addition to talented in-house teams, the sector needs expert
suppliers who share their values and understand how to work with them.</p>

<p>We want people’s experience of public services to be positive and seamless. That
means creating great services that are accessible to everyone. Our approach is
to add value early and often, rapidly researching, testing, learning, and
delivering on time. Wherever we can, we work in the open, sharing our code, and
what we’ve learned.</p>

<p>Our aim is to help the public sector make the most of the opportunities digital
offers to make services better for the people who depend on them. And,
ultimately, to free up more resources for essential front line services like
education, health and social care, housing, welfare, and policing.</p>

<h3 id="our-values">Our values</h3>

<p>We think that it’s very important to have a talented team if we’re going to
