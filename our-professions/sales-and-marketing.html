    Start from solid foundations

    We work with potential and current clients to understand their needs and how
we can deliver value - seeking out opportunities for mutual growth.

    We support our clients to make the right buying decisions, ensuring we focus
on positive outcomes for users and making the most of the resources
available.

    We work closely with our delivery team so we can be open with clients about
who will be available to do the work and realistic delivery timescales.
  
  
    Build positive relationships

    We work in partnership with our clients, and are open and transparent at all
times.

    We remain responsible and accountable to both our delivery teams and clients,
ensuring that we represent them in the right way and can deliver on our
commitments.

    We give our clients the opportunity and platform to talk openly about their
experience of working with us. We listen to what they’re telling us - about
what’s going well and what we need to do differently - and constantly work to
improve things.
  
  
    Find the right work

    We welcome new opportunities, and actively seek input from the dxw team to
help us decide whether an opportunity is ‘dxw shaped’.

    We consider the ethical implications of the work - does it help to create
better digital public services that make people’s lives better?

    We will only take on work that’s a good fit for the team - that won’t put us
under undue strain, where our team will be safe and we can have a positive
relationship with our client.
  
  
    Show the work and the team

    We’re an active part of the digital and tech community that’s working to
build better public services.

    We talk openly about what we’re doing and why, what we’re learning along the
way and share our ideas and expertise. We blog all the time.
  
  
    Have a clear voice

    Whenever we communicate - online or face-to-face - we’re always clear, to the
point, friendly, and professional. You can rely on us to say it like it is.

    We champion the things that matter to us and our clients. We’re bold and
pragmatic and seek to influence change for the better in the way public
services are created and delivered.
  
  
    Communicate with a purpose

    When we communicate, it’s to explain what we’re doing and the impact of our
work so our clients and potential clients understand our areas of expertise
and how we can help them.

    We’re open about our values and the way we work in dxw digital. We give our
team members a voice because we’re proud of our diverse and inclusive
culture.
