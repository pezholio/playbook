by these principles.
  
    Set an example

    Leaders at dxw demonstrate our values in everything we do. We set high
standards of behaviour and inspire both colleagues and clients to do the
same.

    We demonstrate fairness, integrity, and resilience, and build trust with our
actions.
  
  
    Look after people

    Leaders at dxw promote the wellbeing of individuals, teams and communities.
We encourage a supportive culture and inclusive working arrangements. We
prioritise 1:1 time with people to listen and understand their particular
needs.

    We support and defend colleagues in difficult situations. We identify and
deal with poor performance and bad behaviour.
  
  
    Take ownership

    Leaders at dxw welcome responsibility and accountability. We’re proactive,
pick up things that need doing without being asked and push to finish the job
in hand.

    We’re the first to admit mistakes, apologise when wrong and learn for next
time.
  
  
    Deliver for clients

    Leaders at dxw understand how to deliver value for each client and create the
conditions for dxw to do brilliant work. We are not afraid to challenge
clients or ask difficult questions.

    We think commercially and push dxw to grow and strengthen as a business.
  
  
    Provide clarity

    Leaders at dxw communicate clearly and concisely through the right channel.
We question any decisions, goals or explanations that are vague or ambiguous
and work to clarify them.

    We’re open, honest and straightforward in what we say and write. And we
provide specific, understandable and useful feedback.
  
  
    Make good decisions

    Leaders at dxw use evidence and judgement to make good decisions. We know
that timely decisions are important, so we don’t procrastinate or fudge. We
commit to collective decisions, particularly when we originally disagreed.

    We consult broadly, seek out contrary opinions, and listen to quieter voices.
We make sure we can explain our decisions, with context, rationale and
evidence.
  
  
    Point the way

    Leaders at dxw share an inspiring vision for the future of dxw, and each
individual’s part in it.

    On client and dxw projects, we make sure that colleagues understand the
outcomes we want to achieve and the value that they will create.
  
  
    Build the future

    Leaders at dxw hire great people. We actively look for the widest range of
candidates to strengthen our diversity.

    We encourage our colleagues to learn, develop new skills, and pursue their
career aspirations, whether at dxw or elsewhere. And we give people
opportunity and responsibility at the right pace for them.

    We continually improve dxw capability, and the effectiveness and efficiency
of our delivery. We try out new approaches and technologies and give others
the time and space to do the same.
