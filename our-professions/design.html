    Democratise the design process

    Take into account, and value highly, the input of others in the design
process. While we are ultimately responsible for design in a delivery team,
we don’t work in isolation.
  
  
    Value clarity in everything we do

    Use plain language in interfaces, writing and conversation.
  
  
    Overlap with other disciplines

    Work closely with people that have different skills to you, in the knowledge
that different perspectives make our decisions stronger and elevate our work.
  
  
    Communicate constantly

    Never go missing. Our teammates always understand what we’re doing and why,
because we’re all aiming for the same outcome.
  
  
    Know we are not the user

    Do not assume to know how users of our services think or act. We acknowledge
that things such as genetics, upbringing, religious and geographical culture,
and past experiences make us all different. We work closely with our user
researchers to gain understanding and insight about the people that use the
things we design. “One accurate measurement is worth more than a thousand
expert opinions.” ~ Grace Hopper
  
  
    Be educators

    Know that being open about our work, and helping others to understand our
decisions and why we make them, benefits everybody.
  
  
    Be kind

    Be tolerant, understanding, empathetic and compassionate. Look for
opportunities to help and care for others. Putting people at the centre of
everything will help you be a better designer.
  
  
    Embrace questions

    Understand that when people ask questions and give feedback it is to make
something better. If we can not articulate our decisions then we may not have
made the best choice.
  
  
    Ask questions

    Always ask questions and seek the truth; when we understand the problem we
can solve it. When things seem muddy take a step back and try and find the
original intent or gaps in understanding. “If I had an hour to solve a
problem I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes
thinking about solutions.” ~ Albert Einstein
  
  
    Always assume the best intent

    We are passionate about what we do, but we are a team. When you have
difficult conversations or feedback we should always assume that it is coming
from a good place.
  
  
    Tell stories

    When we talk about our work and why we do what we do, do not just state the
facts. Inject some humanity into it; turn it into a story with a beginning, a
middle, and an end.
