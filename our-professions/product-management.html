    Set the destination, don’t chart the course

    Product managers help empower multidisciplinary teams by refining and
articulating the problem the team is trying to solve, and the outcomes
they‘re trying to produce.

    Communicating the vision and goals for a project through a clear and
well-maintained roadmap is a core part of product management.
  
  
    Define and defend scope

    Getting agreement from everyone involved is crucial to successful delivery.

    Product managers should set the direction at the start of a project, and
continue to articulate, communicate and defend the scope throughout, so that
the team can focus on delivering.
  
  
    Convert insight into action

    User research helps inform our objectives, goals, and priorities by telling
us more about the problems users are having with the current state, or the
needs they have for something different.

    Product managers need to be able to balance user research insights with
constraints like time, capacity, and strategic objectives to prioritise the
next most important thing.

    Product managers help the team to work together, across disciplines, to
identify potential solutions before choosing a way forward.
  
  
    Have a service mindset

    Product managers recognise that a digital product is often not the whole
solution to a problem, and that the people operating a new service day to day
are users too.

    We think about the processes and systems around a product, including how
those might change.
  
  
    Communicate clearly how short term outcomes contribute to long term goals

    Product managers need to own and articulate a vision that is consistent and
meaningful to everyone with an interest in the project, from the delivery
team all the way through to the most senior stakeholders, and users.
  
  
    Be present, collaborative, and consistent

    Being available to the team to discuss the unexpected and share in the
decision making is central to building empowered and protected teams.

    Product managers should regularly and actively communicate, review and defend
our decisions - especially the unplanned or unexpected ones.
  
  
    Maintain a focus on outcomes

    In the midst of delivery, key dates can loom large, and teams can be diverted
onto things which seem urgent but aren‘t important.

    Product managers must help teams and stakeholders remain focused on outcomes
over outputs, facilitating discussion and making space for reflection.
  
  
    Lead without authority

    Product managers shouldn‘t be bottlenecks. Product managers and delivery
leads work together to build skilled multidisciplinary teams and create the
space in which those disciplines can do their best work.

    Product managers are open to new tools, techniques and approaches, working
with teams to find what works.
  
  
    Take blame, give credit away

    Good product managers leave their ego at the door, taking negative feedback
on board whilst ensuring the team are rightly recognised for their work and
achievements.

    Being kind is more important than being right - it‘s a good rule of thumb to
enter every conversation without assuming that you already know most, or
best.
  
  
    Strong opinions, softly held

    Product managers make the best decisions based on the available information
with confidence, staying open to the possibility that things could change
when more information is available in the future.

    Product managers communicate the trade-offs they’re making and the rationale
for their decisions so that teams can understand how a decision was reached,
even when they don’t agree.
  
  
    Set clear priorities

    Product managers work with the team, stakeholders and users to define
priorities, and ensure these are clear.
  
  
    Measure outcomes

    Product managers facilitate and work with service designers and business
analysts to work out key metrics and goals for the product and work with the
team to define roadmaps to achieve these goals.
