    Help teams understand people

    Researchers at dxw help our teams build a deep understanding of the people
who use our services. We know that‘s the best way to create public services
that work well for the people who need them.

    We are facilitators, not gatekeepers. We actively involve our colleagues and
clients in research. And openly share what we do, how we do it and why it‘s
important.
  
  
    Find the truth. Tell the truth

    Researchers at dxw create strong evidence and reliable answers so our teams
can act with confidence. We are bold and focus on what‘s most important.

    We know we can learn things that are unexpected and challenging. So we
communicate clearly and sensitively to help everyone make the best decision.

Dana Chisnell and

    Take ethics seriously

    Researchers at dxw know that the safety and trust of participants is our
responsibility. We think about the ethics of our research at every step. From
how we recruit participants and get their informed consent, through how we
store and use the data we collect, to how we share our findings.
  
  
    Be methodical, but not rigid

    Researchers at dxw know that the quality of our findings depends on the
quality of our methods. We use tried and tested methods, and take time to
reflect and continually improve our practice.

    But we also understand that context is important. So we use the best approach
for the question at hand and adapt our ways of working to fit the client and
the project.
  
  
    Learn, share and adapt

    Researchers at dxw work in an agile way. We do research and analysis in small
batches so we can continuously share and adapt to what we learn.
  
  
    Make research inclusive

    Researchers at dxw know how important it is that public services work for all
the people who need to use them. We help teams understand the needs of all
their users, and do research activities that everyone can participate in.
  
  
    Build on existing evidence

    Researchers at dxw help clients build on the knowledge and data they already
have. We combine existing knowledge, poorly understood data and new research
into a coherent picture.
  
  
    Accept and admit constraints

    Researchers at dxw do the best research we can within the constraints we
have. We acknowledge and share the limits of our research and our findings.
And we advocate for more research when it‘s needed to achieve the project
outcomes.

          <h1>User research</h1>
          <p>At dxw, we believe in making decisions based on evidenced user needs. As user
researchers, we help multidisciplinary teams learn about users and recognise the
value of user research. There is no single right way of doing this, but as a
team, we need to stay unified in the way we approach, do, and talk about
research.</p>
