    We deliver the dxw business plan. In particular, we recruit the best people
to meet our mission, manage our finances to allow sustainable growth, and
track performance of objectives to measure ourselves.
  
  
    We are the front door for staff and clients. We help, support and enable dxw
to meet its mission and uphold its values. We do this by being empathetic and
put people over process.
  
  
    As commercial experts we take the burden away from our delivery teams, and
make sure our people, as well as our suppliers get paid, whilst also ensuring
our clients pay us on time.
  
  
    The unit of delivery is always the team, so we ensure staff wellbeing by
providing a safe and inclusive environment. We also support our people to
thrive in all stages of their careers, ensuring they have chance to
continually learn, as well as excellent facilities and the right tools to
enable them to succeed in their careers.
  
  
    We ensure dxw is compliant with all the relevant company and employment
regulations, ensuring we have ISO 27001 accreditation, abide by GDPR
guidelines and insurance.
  
  
    Commercial and business operations can be thankless, but to manage
expectations we remain resilient and take responsibility for our work by
effectively communicating about what we do and why we do it.
